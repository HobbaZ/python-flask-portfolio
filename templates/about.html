            <div class="p-2 col-xs-12 col-sm-6">
                <p>I'm Zac, a passionate freelance web developer based in Sydney. I've always been interested in trying
                    new and
                    different technology stacks, from
                    blogs with Gatsby, maintaining my Shopify store (Ruby on Rails), experimenting with webGL and
                    Three.js, to
                    this portfolio site using Flask and Python.</p>

                <p>When I'm not at work or coding in my free time, I'm designing modular 3D printed products for my
                    Shopify
                    store. I can also sometimes be found at a mini putt range or 10 pin
                    bowling alley.
                </p>

                <p>Don't worry if you can't find me irl, reach out over the internet via my socials or my contact page
                    to start
                    a conversation.</p>
